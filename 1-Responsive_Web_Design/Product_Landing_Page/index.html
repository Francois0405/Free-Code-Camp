            <p class="text">ElectroFitness is an innovative project that will be launched at the beginning of 2025. The project consists of a gym that uses the physical effort of the members and transforms it into electrical energy. This energy is used to reduce the gym's electric bill. The energy generated by users is sustainable and thus reduces carbon emissions. Gym users will earn bonuses thanks to the energy they generate as discounts on the monthly fee.</p>

These panels harness the power of solar energy, transforming our facility into a self-sustaining powerhouse. By leveraging renewable resources, we not only minimize our ecological footprint but also actively participate in the global shift toward clean energy solutions.</p><br>
        <p class="text">This eco-friendly initiative aligns with our dedication to creating a healthier and more sustainable environment, offering our members a unique fitness experience that not only benefits their well-being but also contributes positively to the planet.
