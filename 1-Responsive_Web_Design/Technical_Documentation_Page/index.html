                    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a crucial technology used to enhance the visual presentation of HTML documents. Working in conjunction with HTML, CSS allows developers to define the layout, styling, and appearance of web content. It provides a powerful way to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of a webpage, creating a more engaging user experience.</p>
                    <p>CSS operates on a selector and declaration basis. Selectors target HTML elements, and declarations define how those elements should be styled. This separation of structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) promotes clean code organization and maintainability.</p>
                    <p>Developers can apply CSS rules inline, internally within the HTML document, or externally in a separate stylesheet. Cascading principles dictate how conflicting styles are resolved, with styles cascading from more general to more specific rules.</p>
                    <p>Some key concepts in CSS include the use of classes and IDs for targeted styling, the box model for layout control, and responsive design techniques for adapting to different screen sizes. CSS3, the latest version, introduces features like animations, transitions, and advanced layout options.</p>
                    <p>The CSS <code>color</code> property sets the text color, and the <code>margin</code> property controls spacing around elements.</p>
                    <p>The main characteristics of CSS are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS enhances the visual presentation of HTML documents.</li>
                        <li>It operates on a selector and declaration basis, separating style from structure.</li>
                        <li>CSS rules can be applied inline, internally, or externally.</li>
                        <li>Cascading principles determine how conflicting styles are resolved.</li>
